Magnemite is a screen recorder for websites, built with [Electron](https://electron.atom.io).

Magnemite is useful for getting [🐞 repro steps](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/scottos/2008/08/22/the-value-of-repro-steps-and-why-you-should-care/) from an end user in the form of a video recording 📹.

Did your end user report a bug in your web app? Whether you are a Support team, a Development team, or anyone who deals with "bugs", you can benefit from Magnemite! Simply tell the end user to install Magnemite and use it as they normally use your web app. They can click a button if they run into a bug and now you have a video of their issue!
